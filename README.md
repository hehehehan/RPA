# Data
We use datasets which are sampled from UCF-101 and Kinetics-400. You can download them from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O4XyLw37WqGKqFvWFaE2ps5IAD_shSpG?usp=sharing). (thanks to [@zhipeng-wei](https://github.com/zhipeng-wei)). After downloading them, you should unzip them in the current dictionary.

# Models
We use six pretrained video recognition models on UCF101 and Kinetics-400. You can download them from  [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10KOlWdi5bsV9001uL4Bn1T48m9hkgsZ2?usp=sharing) and [gluoncv](https://cv.gluon.ai/model_zoo/action_recognition.html), respectively. After downloading the UCF-101 models, you should place them into ./checkpoints.
